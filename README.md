# Mobile3-Notes

New Project setup files like .gitgnore and etc files example just copy and paste while creating new Mobile project.


## More Information

Some files in a Mobile project should not be checked into a Git version control repository. You can tell git to ignore certain files by creating a file called **.gitignore** in the top level of your working directory.

## Using the File

Copy the example file **gitignore.example** to the top level of your working directory and rename it *.gitignore* (For both platforms).

Note that git will not ignore a file that was already tracked before a rule was added to this file to ignore it. In such a case the file must be un-tracked, usually with `git rm --cached filename`.
