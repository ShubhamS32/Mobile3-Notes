# Android Notes

New Project setup files like .gitgnore and etc files example just copy and paste while creating new Mobile project.


## Using the gitignore.example

Copy the example file **gitignore.example** to the top level of your working directory and rename it *.gitignore*.

Note that git will not ignore a file that was already tracked before a rule was added to this file to ignore it. In such a case the file must be un-tracked, usually with `git rm --cached filename`.
