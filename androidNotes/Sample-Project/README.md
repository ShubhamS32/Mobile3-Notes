#Setting Up the ADT Bundle
The ADT Bundle provides everything you need to start developing apps, including a version of the Eclipse IDE with built-in ADT (Android Developer Tools) to streamline your Android app development. If you haven't already, go download the [Android ADT Bundle](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

##Install the SDK and Eclipse IDE

1. Unpack the ZIP file (named `adt-bundle-<os_platform>.zip`) and save it to an appropriate location, such as a "Development" directory in your home directory.

2. Open the adt-bundle-`<os_platform>/eclipse/` directory and launch eclipse.

The IDE is already loaded with the Android Developer Tools plugin and the SDK is ready to go.
